The online bootcamp on Udemy has the same curriculum as our
in-person bootcamp. Our in-person bootcamp only runs once
per year and is wait-list based.  The Udemy online course can be
taken at anytime, on your schedule.
What's the difference between
your online and in-person bootcamp?
Since 2019, we have moved all our courses on to Udemy other
than some courses with prior contracts (e.g. the agreement with
have with Google for the Flutter course). You should get our
courses from Udemy.
What's the difference between
your online courses on Udemy and
appbrewery.com?
We teach the course in person over 12 weeks. But we have seen
students online complete the course as quickly as 3 weeks. It
depends if you are going to work full-time or part-time. It can also
be helpful to read around the topics and do more self-directed
research and experimentation.  
How long does the bootcamp take to complete?
The course is designed for students of all levels. The youngest
person we've had on the course is 11, the oldest 86. The most
inexperienced student didn't know what a website is, the most
experienced works for Twitter as a developer. The most important
thing is perseverance and willingness to learn. If you have that
then you'll do great!
I don't have any prior experience or a technical
background, can I join the bootcamp?
